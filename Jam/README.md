## Version 1.1.0!

As of the 1.1.0 update Jotunn is required to run this mod. A version check will be performed on server connection to ensure all players have the mod installed properly.

Configurations should sync on servers and live update on changing the randyknapp.mods.jam.cfg file. The old json file is no longer supported, please use the new bepinex configurations!

Please note that any jams crafted will retain their values on a live configuration change until they are reloaded!
